Q1. Write a closure function that generates multiples 
of 3.
Make sure the inner function returns that number 
after calculation.


Q2. Write a function that:-
    1. Takes an array and reverses numbers in 
    the array but does not change the original 
    array declared outside the function.
    2. adds numbers like this when called:-
    	add(2)(3) will return 5.

Bonus:- ( Great for understanding the concept)

 Write a function that takes a big array which 
 holds other arrays that have numbers in them 
 and reverses all the numbers in each array and 
 returns the new array.
