Make an input box with a button next to it.
Create a empty <div> to hold dynamically created paragraphs.


i) On click of button add a paragraph to <div> with text what user provided in input box.
ii) Add the same element to localStorage as an array.
iii) On page reload read from  localStorage and create paragraphs again based on the array stored in localStorage.
iv) Make sure empty strings are ignored as input.
v) Handle the case where localStorage is cleared. Your app should handle that case to make a new array and update accordingly.
