Q1. Make a button named 'toggle', when clicked checks if element with id="para" is visible then 
make it invisible, otherwise make it visible again.

Use Ternary Operator to do it. ( boolean ? value: value)

Q2. Pass to a function an object called 'user' which has'personalInfo' and 'personalInfo' has 
'yearsSinceMarried' which will be a number if it is present. Check if user is married. Function 
should return a boolean. 

User may or may not have 'yearsSinceMarried' in it.

Use only && and || operators to return a boolean.
Function must return true or false!

Sample call with object: 
	function checkMarried(user) {
		return ____ && ____ && _______.........
	}
	// can also be empty.
	var testUser = {
	 personalInfo: {
	 	yearsSinceMarried: 3
	 }
	};
	checkMarried(testUser)


Q3. Make a div with 500px height, 500px width and border: 1px solid red.
    When the user brings mouse on top it should move away based on a random number generated 
	between [30-150]. ( Means the margin in any direction will increase or decrease). Another 
	random number between [1-4] will decide which direction margin to be changed.

    So as you bring your mouse on top it should keep moving around every time mouseover event triggers.
    You can decide margin directions as 1 is top, 2 is right, 3 is bottom, 4 is left.
    Example:-
    Mouseover Event 1: random number for margin = 50 and direction is 2
    	Box will move 50px to left. ( marginRight will be 50px )
    Mouseover Event 2: random number for margin = 100 and direction is 3
    	Box will move 100px to top. ( marginBottom will be 100px )
